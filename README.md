 C2 & Velociraptor Forensics Lab

This repository documents a cybersecurity lab simulation involving red team operations using a C2 framework and blue team digital forensics using Velociraptor.

 Overview
- Onboarded an agent using a C2 framework on a simulated Windows VM
- Executed post-exploitation tasks (e.g., process listing, persistence)
- Collected forensic artifacts via Velociraptor for investigation
- Analyzed registry keys, event logs, and execution timelines

 Key Skills Demonstrated
- Command & Control operations
- Endpoint forensics with Velociraptor
- Windows internals (processes, registry)
- Blue team threat detection and response

Files Included
- `/report/` ‚Äì Full written lab report (DOCX)
- `/screenshots/` ‚Äì Images of tasks, callbacks, Velociraptor queries
- `/logs/` ‚Äì Output logs from agent and Velociraptor
- `/artifacts/` ‚Äì Extracted forensic artifacts (CSV)

‚ÄúThe agent successfully beaconed to the C2 server and established persistence via registry keys. Velociraptor hunts revealed malicious artifacts, execution timestamps, and supported timeline analysis.‚Äù
